# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
My initial thoguths about the python programming language is that it is very similar to Javascript. Python does have different formatting when it comes to coding as it isn't the same for Java but the idea for coding lists and printing words is the same. Python is new to me, so while we were going through some of the basics it seems like it could get tricky to know how to code, but it seems like it uses  


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
Some similarities and differences that I found between python and other programming lanuages that I have used in the past is the way that some of the functions work, like printing texts or making lists is very similar. 


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
Some things thay I learned through this assignent is that python is a coding language that is very similar to Javascript. Also that python can be a lot of debugging as making mistakes can happen a lot when you run a code.
